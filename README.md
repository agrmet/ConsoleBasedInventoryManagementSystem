# A simple inventory
# ==================
A console application is required to manage a store's inventory. The application must provide functionality to record and track items, including books and groceries. 
Features should include the ability to add, update, and remove items along with details such as name, price, and quantity. 
The system should allow for categorization of items for better organization. 
Navigation should be manageable via command-line instructions, and the application must ensure data persistence to safeguard inventory information between sessions. 
It should include error handling mechanisms that alert to incorrect inputs and allow for correction without disrupting the application's functionality. 
The tool is intended to streamline the inventory management process, making it more efficient and reducing the likelihood of errors.
